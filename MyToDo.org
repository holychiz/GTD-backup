*** Learn about your body the hard way:
**** put your body through extreme physical training to learn how it works
            Training to running a marathon taught me the signals my body is telling me about its conditions, and desire.  So many health experts advise us to "listen to our body", but for years I really don't know what that means. Perhaps you can find a better way, but for me, the vigorous training regime to complete a marathon fine tuned my sense of physical beings.  I became more aware of the sleep signals, patterns, my food cravings and what to eat.  I can pretty much pinpoint the moment when I catch a cold (didn't really want this "superpower", but there it is :) )
